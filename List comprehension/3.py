# Python list comprehension vs map

# List comprehension allows filtering, there is no filtering in the map.
# List comprehension returns the list of results whereas the map only returns the map objects.
# The map is faster to call the defined function whereas lambda is not required to call the defined function.
# Map performance is better comparing to list comprehension.
