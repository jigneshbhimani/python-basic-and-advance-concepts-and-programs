# Removing Elements from the Array:

# Elements can be removed from the array by using built-in remove() function but an Error arises if element doesnâ€™t exist in the set.
# Remove() method only removes one element at a time, to remove range of elements, iterator is used.
# pop() function can also be used to remove and return an element from the array, but by default it removes only the last element of the array, to remove element from a specific position of the array, index of the element is passed as an argument to the pop() method.
# Remove method in List will only remove the first occurrence of the searched element.


import array
arr = array.array('i', [1, 2, 3, 1, 5])
print ("The new created array is : ", end ="")
for i in range (0, 5):
	print (arr[i], end =" ")
print ("\r")

# using pop() to remove element at 2nd position
print ("The popped element is : ", end ="")
print (arr.pop(2))

# printing array after popping
print ("The array after popping is : ", end ="")
for i in range (0, 4):
	print (arr[i], end =" ")
print("\r")

# using remove() to remove 1st occurrence of 1
arr.remove(1)

# printing array after removing
print ("The array after removing is : ", end ="")
for i in range (0, 3):
	print (arr[i], end =" ")
